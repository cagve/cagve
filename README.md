### 👋 Hi there!
 I’m Carlos Aguilera Ventura(@cagve), I hold a Bachelor degree in Philosophy and a Interuniversity Master in Logic and Philosopy of Science. I am currently doing my PhD at [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) thanks to to a MESRI contract, under the supervision of Jonathan Ben-Naim and Andreas Herzig.

#### PhD topic
When an agent learns a new piece of information that contradicts the beliefs she has held up to now then she has to give up some of the old beliefs. This is a pervasive problem in knowledge representation. The aim of the thesis is to study **belief revision operations**
for *modal logics* in terms of **distance based models**, **rationality postulates**, and **algorithms**. 

 - 📖 Modal and epistemic logic
 - 📖 Belief Revision
 - 📖 Automatic reasoning

#### Projects
- 🌱 [Epistemic Model Checker](https://github.com/cagve/EpistemicModelChecker) - A software tool for determining the truth value of modal formulas in Kripke-style multi-agent models.
- 🌲 [Epistemic Tableau System](https://github.com/cagve/epistemic-tree) - A tableau method implementation for epistemic logic.
- ✍️ [LogiDoc](http://logidoc.es) - An easy tool for writting formulas. 
- 🔥 [TexBox](https://github.com/cagve/texbox) - Just nvim + LaTeX
